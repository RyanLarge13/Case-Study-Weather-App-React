  <h1 class="major-heading">Weather App React</h1>
  <p class="intro"><strong>Weather App React</strong> is a client side rendering application that fetches data from two sources that provide JSON data about weather all around the world. Using React, the client side code will fetch your location and provide you with the weather in your area in a formatted way that is <strong>readable</strong> and <strong>accessible</strong> to the user of the application</p>
  <section id="goals" class="goals-sec">
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>The goal to building this application was to show case my skills in <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, managing <strong>API requests</strong> and the data that comes along with calling a detailed and very complex API.</p>

  <section id="challenges" class="challenges-sec">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>What <strong>data</strong> should the interface consist of??<br /> What UI will give an <strong>appealing</strong> but <strong>simplistic</strong> look and feel??<br /> How will the code remain <strong>clean</strong> with a pluthera of variables to cosider??</p>
  </section>
  <section id="purpose" class="purpose-sec">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The leading motivation for building this application was to introduce my brain to more <strong>advanced</strong> levels of handling data and minipulating state with <strong>React</strong>, to provide people with a real example of a complex system of <strong>data management</strong> to refer to when creating their own works of art, and to create an application that is <strong>useful</strong> and <strong>easy</strong> for the public to use.</p>
