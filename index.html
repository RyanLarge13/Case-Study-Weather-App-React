    <h1 class="major-heading">Weather App React</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      <strong>Weather App React</strong> is a client side rendering application
      that fetches data from two sources that provide JSON data about weather
      all around the world. Using React, the client side code will fetch your
      location and provide you with the weather in your area in a formatted way
      that is <strong>readable</strong> and <strong>accessible</strong> to the
      user of the application
    </p>
    <section id="goals" class="sec goals-sec">
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        The goal to building this application was to show case my skills in
        <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, managing
        <strong>API requests</strong> and the data that comes along with calling
        a detailed and very complex API.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Format Dates & Time</li>
        <li>Separate data between specific components</li>
        <li>Construct a user friendly interface</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="goal-btns">
        <a href="https://github.com/RyanLarge13/Weather-App-React/"

        ></a>
        <a href="https://weather-app-react-lac.vercel.app/"
          ><button><i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i></button
        ></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        To do this, current, daily & hourly weather data was split between 3
        components of the like to manage state and organize the structure.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="challenges" class="sec challenges-sec">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What <strong>data</strong> should the interface consist of??</li>
        <li>
          What UI will give an <strong>appealing</strong> but
          <strong>simplistic</strong> look and feel??
        </li>
        <li>
          How will the code remain <strong>clean</strong> with a pluthera of
          variables to cosider??
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These top 3 concerns built the foundation behind this application that
        triggered the motivation behind <strong>structuring</strong> and
        <strong>organization</strong>. These two important aspects were of top
        priority.
      </p>
      <h3>Data Structuring</h3>
      <p>
        Within one API request all current, hourly & daily information is
        retrieved. This data was split between relative components that live
        within <code>&lt&nbspApp /&gt</code>
      </p>
      <h3>UI/UX</h3>
      <p>
        A user interface that is filled with light animations and is considerate
        to the daytime hours in one's current area where of top concern. The
        hours of daylight were calculated comparatively to the
        <code>new Date()</code> method & the sunset and sunrise data provided by
        the API.
      </p>
      <h3>Orginization</h3>
      <p>
        The file structure was to remain simple and small. This is a SPA
        application and no routers, context or state management libraries were
        necessary. The file structure lays out as follows...
      </p>
      <div class="file-code-container">
        <div class="red"></div>
        <div class="yellow"></div>
        <div class="green"></div>
        <code>
          - public<br />
          &nbsp - index.html<br />
          - assets<br />
          &nbsp - svgs <br />
          &nbsp - images <br />
          - src<br />
          &nbsp - components<br />
          &nbsp &nbsp - File.jsx <br />
          &nbsp &nbsp - file.scss<br />
          &nbsp - App.jsx<br />
          &nbsp - App.scss<br />
          &nbsp - index.jsx
        </code>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="purpose" class="sec purpose-sec">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The leading motivation for building this application was to introduce my
        brain to more <strong>advanced</strong> levels of handling data and
        minipulating state with <strong>React</strong>, to provide people with a
        real example of a complex system of <strong>data management</strong> to
        refer to when creating their own works of art, and to create an
        application that is <strong>useful</strong> and
        <strong>easy</strong> for the public to use.
